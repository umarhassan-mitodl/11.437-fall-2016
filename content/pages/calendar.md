**Introduction to Capital Markets; Capital Market Imperfections and Financing Gaps; Local Development Finance Systems**

This class covers the institutional structure and operations of private capital markets, including the direct "public" markets and the "private" markets of financial intermediaries. Discussion of these markets will emphasize their economic development role, which institutions are most important for community-based economic development, and the capital market falures and imperfections that occur in private capital markets. These market failures define the financing gaps that economic development finance programs and institutions are designed to address. A two-part framework for interventions to address captial market failures and financing gaps will be discussed. This class also introduces approaches to thinking about how capital markets and development finance relate to larger systems that influence how capital is deployed to advance economic development goals. Information on development finance in Detroit is provided to provide a context to consider the application of these concepts to a city.

**Business Finance Needs; Business Financing Instruments**

This class looks at the many instruments used to finance business enterprises, emphasizing the difference between debt and equity, the varied forms of debt financing, and the advantages and disadvantages associated with different financing instruments. The appropriateness of different financing instruments for various stages of business development and capital needs is also discussed along with the distinct capital needs and issues faced by small firms. Empirical data on how small enterprises are financed will be compared to the expectations based on capital market and firm development stage theories. Finally, we will review the basic finance terms and calculations related to debt and equity instruments.

**Analyzing Finance Needs II: Evaluating Firms for Financing; Financial Statement Analysis**

This class expands on the understanding of financial statements to develop analytical tools used to evaluate the financial needs of companies and find appropriate financial instruments to meet these needs. A framework for evaluating a firm for economic development financing is discussed and key financial analysis tools are introduced: ratio analysis, common size financial statements, and forecasting cash flow and debt service capacity. Two tools developed to help economic development organizations evaluate projects using community impact and triple bottom line approaches are presented in the readings and will be touched upon in class. We will also review the business financial analysis worksheet to discuss how ratio analysis and cash flow analysis is used to inform business lending decisions.

**Municipal Finance Tools II: Tax Increment Financing; Assessment Districts and PACE; Business Improvement Districts**

Tax increment financing and assessment districts are effect ways to finance projects or investments where the benefits are fairly localized and revenues to support these investments can be generated from new tax revenues or fees from this local area. This class covers the issues associated with TIF and assessment district financing, and explores their application to economic development projects and plans. Detroit's use of TIF to finance a sports arena provides an example of TIF as a project financing tool as well as questions about the best use of TIF. The Orlando downtown TIF case will be used to highlight financing and debt structure issues associated with TIF supported municipal debt. The growing use of assessment financing for energy efficiency and solar energy (PACE) will also be covered.

**Tax Credit and Financing; Historic Tax Credits; New Market Tax Credits; State Tax Credits**

Tax credit financing has become increasingly important in economic development finance, especially with the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, which is one of the most important federal programs to stimulate investment in low-income areas. With over ten years of implementation, the processes and uses for this program are well established, albeit somewhat complex and byzantine. This session is devoted to providing an overview of tax credit financing and a deeper dive to understand the NMTC program and its use to advance economic and community development goals. This class will also look at some examples of how tax credits are being used in Detroit and Michigan's changes to its credits program.

**Program Models III: Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs); Community Development Credit Unions; Community Development Loan Funds**

Community based and controlled financial institutions have been a small but rapidly growing source of development finance. These institutions, referred to as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are privately funded through local deposits, loans, and philanthropic support. We will review the two major institutional models: credit unions and loan funds, the particular benefits, issues and constraints inherent in these models, and the emergence of large multi-faceted CDFIs that combine a core financial intermediary with other related development and policy functions. The Los Angeles study reviews CDFIs' collective contribution to addressing housing and economic developments needs on a city-wide basis and provides a way to look at the effectiveness of CDFIs as a system and institutional policy to pursue community and economic development goals. The Cleveland CDFI case provides an opportunity to look at how a city can apply and support the CDFI model in light of changing market conditions and economic development priorities.

**Program Models IV: Microenterprise Development**

The capital and technical assistance needs of very small businesses pose special challenges. Over the past two decades, numerous programs have been developed to support the creation and financing of "micro-enterprises" as strategies to alleviate poverty, assist the unemployed and stimulate local job and income generation. In this class, we will examine the microenterprise development and lending program models and practice. Lisa Servon's article an assessment of microenterprise development in Michigan and the Lawrence Working Capital Program, will provide the basis for class discussion on ways to heighten the impact of microenterprise programs.

**Issues in Program Management: Program Planning and Design; Financial Models and Projections**

The first step in developing successful economic development finance programs is defining clear goals and designing a program to achieve these goals on a sustainable basis. In this session on program planning and design, we consider how finance programs relate to an organization's mission and strategy, how market analysis can be conducted and inform institutional strategy, and new program or product development. We will use the term projects to explore the challenges, issues, and approaches to program planning and design. Continuing the theme of development finance as a system, we will consider approaches to analysis and planning for the overall finance system.

**Issues in Program Management: Marketing and Origination; Underwriting and Structuring Investments; Servicing and Portfolio Management**

The core competency in operating loan funds is making good decisions on which loans or investments to make, and effective oversight of these deals to help keep them on track and resolve problems. This class will focus on these activities, including the options for organizing and managing theses functions and best practices in the field, and approaches to incorporating more comprehensive "triple bottom line" metrics into investment decisions. Effective program management with limited resources -- typical of public sector and community organizations -- is prominent concern along with linking financing programs to other economic development resources. The Rural Enterprises case will be used to explore challenges and effective practices in managing development finance operations.

**Issues in Program Management: Capital Management and Recapitalization**

With limited resources and capital needs that far exceed available funds, economic development finance programs are constantly challenged to manage financial assets to maximize capital for new investments and to expand their capitalization. This session will disucss the policies and tools to enhance the use of assets and expand institutional capital resources and discuss how to manage assets and liabilities for maxiumum effectiveness. The Manufacturing Fund case will look at different approaches to capitalization and use of financial models to assess recapitalization options.
